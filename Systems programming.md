Systems programming refers to the development of software that interacts closely with a computer's hardware. Think of it as building the foundations upon which other applications run.

Here's a breakdown:
- **Low-Level Control:** Systems programming involves working with the computer's operating system, device drivers, and hardware components. This often requires precise control over memory management and hardware resources.
- **Performance and Efficiency:** Since systems programs are close to the hardware, they need to be highly efficient and performant. This is where languages like Rust, C, and C++ shine.
- **Examples:** Operating systems (like Windows, Linux, macOS), embedded systems (like those in cars or appliances), device drivers (software that allows your computer to communicate with printers or graphics cards), and game engines are all examples of systems programming.
