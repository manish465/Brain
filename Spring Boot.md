Spring Boot is an open-source Java framework used for programming standalone, production-grade Spring-based applications with a bundle of libraries that make project startup and management easier.

Spring Boot is a [[convention-over-configuration]] extension for the [[Spring framework |Spring]] Java platform intended to help minimize configuration concerns while creating Spring-based applications.

The application can still be adjusted for specific needs, but the initial Spring Boot project provides a preconfigured "opinionated view" of the best configuration to use with the Spring platform and selected third-party libraries.
