Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return _the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping_.

**Note** that intervals which only touch at a point are **non-overlapping**. For example, `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]` are non-overlapping.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = `[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]`
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = `[[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]`
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intervals = `[[1,2],[2,3]]`
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 105`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `-5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104`

```Java
class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);

        int[] curr = intervals[0];
        int count = 0;

        for(int i=1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            if(curr[1] > intervals[i][0]) {
                count++;
            } else {
                curr = intervals[i];
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```


### **Key Idea**

If two intervals **overlap**, we must remove **one**. The best strategy is to remove the **one with the larger end time** because:

1. **It leaves more room for future intervals** (reduces chances of future overlaps).
2. **The interval with the smaller end time is more restrictive**—it ends earlier and allows more intervals to fit after it.
