## What is a User Story
A **user story** is a simple, natural-language description of a feature told from the perspective of the end user. It usually follows this structure:

> **As a `[user role]`, I want `[goal]` so that `[reason]`.**

For example:

> **As an event organizer, I want to create and configure a new event... so that I can start selling tickets.**

This keeps the focus on the _user's needs_, not just technical requirements.
