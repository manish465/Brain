**Definition**: CI is the practice of automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository several times a day.
### **Key Aspects of CI**

- Developers push code changes frequently to a version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
- Automated **builds** and **tests** are triggered to verify that the new changes do not break the existing codebase.
- If the build or tests fail, developers are notified immediately.
### **Popular CI Tools**

- Jenkins
- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI/CD
- CircleCI
- Travis CI
