A large language model (LLM) is a type of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) program that can recognize and generate text, among other tasks. LLMs are trained on huge sets of data â€” hence the name "large." LLMs are built on machine learning: specifically, a type of neural network called a [[transformer model]].
