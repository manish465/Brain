**libGDX AI** is an **artificial intelligence (AI) framework** for **libGDX**, providing common AI techniques used in games. It helps developers implement AI logic without reinventing the wheel.

### **Key Features of libGDX AI**

1. **Pathfinding** – A* (A-Star), Hierarchical Pathfinding, and other algorithms for navigating game worlds.
2. **Steering Behaviors** – Movement behaviors like **seek, flee, pursue, evade, wander, and obstacle avoidance**.
3. **Behavior Trees** – Modular decision-making AI, often used for NPCs and enemies.
4. **Finite State Machines (FSMs)** – Simple AI with different "states" (e.g., idle, attack, patrol).
5. **Message Handling** – Communication between AI agents.
6. **Utility AI** – Decision-making based on priorities and scores.
