## Description
An application that automatically generates detailed, professional-quality `README.md` files for GitHub repositories by analyzing their structure, content, and metadata.  
The application leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to create human-readable documentation based on repository data (file trees, code snippets, and existing metadata).

The goal is to save developers time, improve project onboarding, and ensure that even minimal or undocumented repositories have presentable, informative README files.
